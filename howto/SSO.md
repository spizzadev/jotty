# SSO with OIDC

`jotty·page` supports any OIDC provider (Authentik, Auth0, Keycloak, Okta, etc.) with these requirements:

- Supports PKCE (most modern providers do)
- Can be configured as a public client (no client secret needed)
- Provides standard OIDC scopes (openid, profile, email)

1. Configure your OIDC Provider:

- Client Type: Public
- Grant Type: Authorization Code with PKCE
- PKCE Code Challenge Method: S256
  - _**note** S256 is the only PKCE method Jotty supports_
- Scopes: openid, profile, email
- Redirect URI: https://YOUR_APP_HOST/api/oidc/callback
- Post-logout URI: https://YOUR_APP_HOST/

2. Get these values from your provider:

- Client ID
- OIDC Issuer URL (usually ends with .well-known/openid-configuration)

3. Set environment variables:

```yaml
services:
  jotty:
    environment:
      - SSO_MODE=oidc
      - OIDC_ISSUER=https://YOUR_SSO_HOST/issuer/path
      - OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
      - APP_URL=https://your-jotty-domain.com # if not set defaults to http://localhost:<port>
      # Optional security enhancements:
      - OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret # Enable confidential client mode (if your provider requires it)
      - SSO_FALLBACK_LOCAL=yes # Allow both SSO and local login
      - OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS=admins # Map IDP groups claim to admin role
      - OIDC_ADMIN_ROLES=admins # Map IDP roles claim to admin role
      - OIDC_USER_GROUPS=jotty_users,app_users # Restrict access to users in these groups (admins always allowed)
      - OIDC_USER_ROLES=user,member # Restrict access to users with these roles (admins always allowed)
      - OIDC_GROUPS_SCOPE=groups # Scope to request for groups (set to empty string or "no" to disable for providers like Entra ID)
      - OIDC_LOGOUT_URL=https://authprovider.local/realms/master/logout # Custom logout URL for global logout
      # Optional for reverse proxy issues:
      # - INTERNAL_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Use if getting 403 errors after SSO login
```

**Note**: When OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET is set, jotty·page switches to confidential client mode using client authentication instead of PKCE. This is more secure but requires provider support.

Dev verified Providers:

- Auth0 (`OIDC_ISSUER=https://YOUR_TENANT.REGION.auth0.com`)
- Authentik (`OIDC_ISSUER=https://YOUR_DOMAIN/application/o/APP_SLUG/`)

Other providers will likely work, but I can at least guarantee these do as I have test them both locally.

Provider's specific notes:

- **Google** provider doesn't support usage of `groups` with OIDC authentication, so do NOT set the `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` environment variable.
- **Entra ID** provider allows usage of admin groups with `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS={Entra Group ID}` variable. For that, ensure to include optional `groups` claim in the 'Token Configuration' pane of your 'Enterprise Registration' AND define the environment variable to `OIDC_GROUPS_SCOPE="no"` or `OIDC_GROUPS_SCOPE=""`. Alternatively, use `OIDC_ADMIN_ROLES=role-name` to make use of Application Groups configured in Entra.

p.s. **First user to sign in via SSO when no local users exist becomes admin automatically.**

## Troubleshooting

### 403 Forbidden Error After SSO Login (Behind Reverse Proxy)

If you successfully authenticate via SSO but get redirected back to the login page, and your logs show:

```
MIDDLEWARE - sessionCheck: Response { ... status: 403 ... }
MIDDLEWARE - session is not ok
```

This means the app is trying to validate your session by calling its own API through the external URL, but your reverse proxy is blocking it.

**Solution**: Set the `INTERNAL_API_URL` environment variable:

```yaml
environment:
  - INTERNAL_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

This tells the app to use `localhost` for internal API calls instead of going through the reverse proxy. The default value is already `http://localhost:3000`, but explicitly setting it can help in some edge cases.

**Why this happens**: When `APP_URL` is set to your external domain (e.g., `https://jotty.domain.com`), the middleware tries to validate sessions by making a fetch request to `https://jotty.domain.com/api/auth/check-session`. This request goes through your reverse proxy, which may block it with a 403 Forbidden response due to security policies or misconfigurations.

### My Super Admin/System Owner User Is Not Using SSO

The first user to register in the system is the "Super Admin", referred to as "System Owner" in the web interface.

If this user is not an SSO user, or if you need to change the super admin to a different user, you can update their
super admin status using the `update-super-admin.sh` script below.

> Run from the server **outside** of the Docker container, if using Docker.
> You need write permissions to the `users.json` file. You will if running this as `root`.

1. Locate your `data` volume location on the server filesystem and the `users.json` file. e.g. if using the example `docker-compose.yml`, under
   `volumes` you will see `./data:/app/data:rw`. The `data` volume is under the location of your compose file, making
   the full path to `users.json`:
   `<compose_location>/data/users.json`

2. Run the `update-super-admin.sh` script with the appropriate arguments to update the super admin user:

   ```bash
   wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fccview/jotty/main/scripts/update-super-admin.sh | bash -s -- <new super admin> <users.json location>
   ```

   Alternatively download the script and run it directly.

   Omit the arguments (`wget -qO- ... | bash`) for help text.

   The old Super Admin user will be left as an Admin. The new Super Admin has the ability to delete the old user if
   you choose to do so.

## Advanced: Using Docker Secrets

<details>
<summary>Docker Secrets configuration</summary>

For enhanced security in production environments, you can store OIDC credentials in files instead of environment variables. This prevents secrets from appearing in `docker inspect` output.

**Example docker-compose.yml:**

```yaml
services:
  jotty:
    environment:
      - SSO_MODE=oidc
      - OIDC_ISSUER=https://YOUR_SSO_HOST/issuer/path
      - OIDC_CLIENT_ID_FILE=/run/secrets/oidc_client_id
      - OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/oidc_client_secret
      - APP_URL=https://your-jotty-domain.com
    secrets:
      - oidc_client_id
      - oidc_client_secret

secrets:
  oidc_client_id:
    file: ./secrets/oidc_client_id.txt
  oidc_client_secret:
    file: ./secrets/oidc_client_secret.txt
```

**Create the secret files:**

```bash
mkdir secrets
echo "your_client_id" > secrets/oidc_client_id.txt
echo "your_client_secret" > secrets/oidc_client_secret.txt
chmod 600 secrets/*
```

**Note:** You can mix and match - use `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` directly and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` for the secret, or vice versa. The `_FILE` variants take priority if both are set. Most users can skip this and use regular environment variables.
